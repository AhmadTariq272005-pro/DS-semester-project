# **Task A: Making the Data Structures Project Fully Stable**

The project was tested and finalized to ensure that all major operations work correctly without crashes or logical errors. No new features were added during this phase.

### **Add / Insert Operations**

* Words can be inserted normally using a linked list.
* Words can also be inserted at a specific position.
* Edge cases such as inserting at position 1 and inserting in an empty list were handled correctly.

### **Delete / Remove Operations**

* Deleting the last word works safely and updates pointers correctly.
* Deleting a word at a specific position handles invalid positions without crashing.
* Deleting the first word using queue-based logic works correctly.
* Safe checks were added to avoid deletion from an empty list.

### **Search / Find Operations**

* Word searching is handled during replace operations.
* If the word does not exist, the program displays a proper message instead of failing.

### **Update Operations**

* Editing a word at a specific position works correctly.
* Replacing words updates all matching occurrences in the linked list.

### **Display / Traverse Operations**

* Text is displayed correctly using queue-based FIFO traversal.
* Empty text cases are handled properly and display meaningful messages.

### **Stability Fixes Applied**

* Prevented undo and redo operations from running on empty stacks.
* Fixed invalid pointer access when positions are out of range.
* Cleared redo stack after new insert operations to avoid incorrect redo behavior.
* Ensured no infinite loops or segmentation faults occur during execution.
