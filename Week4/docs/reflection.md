# Reflection – Week 4 (Final Lab)

## Ahmad Tariq
I mainly worked on implementing and stabilizing the linked list operations such as insert, delete, and edit.  
I learned how different data structures like stacks and queues can work together in a single project.  
If I had one more week, I would improve the project by adding file handling to save and load text.

## Hassaan Ghauri
My main contribution was managing the undo and redo functionality using stacks and ensuring it worked correctly.  
I learned how stack-based operations help in reversing actions efficiently.  
With extra time, I would enhance error handling and improve user input validation.

## Tabsher Hussain
I focused on queue-based features such as text display and edit history management.  
I learned how queues follow the FIFO principle and how they can be applied in real applications.  
If given another week, I would work on improving the user interface and making the program more interactive.
