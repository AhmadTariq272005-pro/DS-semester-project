# **Task B: Code Cleanup and Modular Glow-Up**

The code was cleaned and organized to improve readability, maintainability, and professionalism without changing its functionality.

### **Code Readability Improvements**

* Removed unused variables and unnecessary comments.
* Used clear and meaningful function and variable names.
* Added helpful comments to explain complex logic.

### **Modularization**

* Broke long sections of code into smaller helper functions.
* Created separate functions for:

  * Menu display
  * Edit history display
* This improved code structure and reduced repetition.

### **Logic Cleanup**

* Added proper validation for user inputs such as positions.
* Ensured stacks and queues are used safely with empty checks.
* Organized code into clear sections for linked list, stack, queue, and main logic.

### **Overall Result**

* The program is now clean, stable, and easy to understand.
* The code follows good programming practices suitable for a final lab submission.
* All required operations work correctly with improved structure and clarity.
