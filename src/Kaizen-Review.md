# Kaizen Improvement Review

| What was built | Problem or limitation found | Improvement idea | Team member responsible | Expected impact |
|---------------|----------------------------|------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Linked List based text editor (insert, delete, edit, replace) | Program could crash on invalid position input | Added position validation and null pointer checks | Ahmad Tariq | Improved stability and prevented runtime errors |
| Undo and Redo functionality using Stack | Undo/Redo attempted when stack was empty | Added empty stack checks before operations | Hassaan Ghauri | Smooth undo/redo behavior without crashes |
| Queue-based edit history and FIFO text display | Empty text or history caused unclear output | Added empty queue handling and clear messages | Tabsher Hussain | Better user experience and clearer output |
| Menu-driven program structure | Code was difficult to read and maintain | Refactored code and added meaningful comments | Group Collaboration | Cleaner code and easier future improvements |
